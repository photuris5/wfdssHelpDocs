As the Training and Production environments become available for user access, a wide-spread communication campaign will be initiated and will target users of the current WFDSS system. </p>
                                                <p>This is a Testing environment similar to WFDSS Classic Training – actions taken in the UAT will not have any consequences to the decisions related to actual fires.&#160;It (probably) can’t be broken.</p>

                                        <p>The target release date of the WFDSS NextGen Production environment is planned for Spring 2025, when WFDSS NG will become the official system of record for wildland fires that escape initial attack.  The timing of this transition will be communicated with all users with adequate notice and targeting a time of the year when historically few wildland fire decisions are being published to ensure a smooth transfer. Wildland Fire Management Research, Development and Application (WFM RD&amp;A) team members will be fully involved in facilitating both the transfer of active incidents and providing pre-season training. </p>
                                        <p>The Training (WFDSS NG EDU) instance of WFDSS NG is being released to the field prior to the release of the Production environment to allow users to become familiar with the similarities and differences in the functionality of WFDSS Classic and WFDSS NG in real-time. </p>

                                        <p>The modernization of the WFDSS application is being realized through a full redesign and reconfiguration utilizing an agile process where the end result will not only preserve the key functionality of the operational version of WFDSS, now referred to as WFDSS Classic, while incorporating some key foundational technology changes that will improve user experience. This application will include a new user interface as well as an updated systems architecture. It is estimated that WFDSS NextGen will host over 8,000 active users annually and will reference 100 to 150 data services within the mapping interface. </p>
                                        <p>The initial production release will include the features deemed part of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and will include the necessary features to allow decision makers to fully progress through the decision framework and publish a decision.  </p>

FSPro was also the most difficult model to incorporate and the most complex due to the dependencies on the Fire Environment Mapping System (FEMS) to query the weather imports for analyses. Although there are still challenges and issues with the FEMS queries needed to make FSPro work consistently and reliably, FSPro is currently integrated and working.    </p>

                                                <p>Relative Risk - Also known as the “Part B: Relative Risk Assessment”, is part of the “NWCG PMS 236 - Wildland Fire Risk and Complexity Assessment”. In the past, this tool had deviated from the published PMS – 236 within WFDSS Classic, however currently both WFDSS Classic and WFDSS NextGen will more closely follow the PMS 236 in order to align with NWCG guidance. The deployment in WFDSS NextGen does have some advantages over the paper copy (PDF) in that the application can automatically present products derived from the spatial Inventory of the planning area, and in future, present other information such as fire behavior analysis, helping to inform the Relative Risk ratings. Relative Risk has been further enhanced by the fact that the user never leaves the map screen, allowing for the user to consult the map on the fly as the Relative Risk is populated vs paging back and forth between the map and the Relative Risk.   </p>

                                                <p>Strategic Decision – The “Decision” is a multi-part product that incorporates analytics and the components of the Risk Informed Decision Process into a comprehensive format for use in Wildland Fire Management. For the context of the MVP however the decision is broken into its core components which are listed below:  </p>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>
                                                        <p> Strategic Assessment(s) - Strategic Assessments in WFDSS NextGen is analogous to the Objectives and Requirements section in WFDSS Classic. Minor differences have been implemented in WFDSS NextGen including, making all Spatial Assessments Spatial (Tied to Feature Layer and Feature Name), linking the Critical Values at Risk (CVAR) from the ISAP process, the additional categories of Spatial Assessments (SA), highlighting in the decision of select SAs and the pre-clipping of Spatial Fire Planning Shapes. </p>
                                                    </li>

                                                        <p> Strategic Course of Action - The Course of Action (COA) in WFDSS NextGen will be an explicitly spatial process but otherwise will be very similar to COA in WFDSS Classic and is a required part of the decision in that there must be at least one COA per decision. </p>
                                                    </li>

                                                        <p> Cost – Estimated Final Cost is an important component of the decision in that it is tied to AA/LO certification levels, as well as the expected complexity and duration of the incident.  </p>

In WFDSS NextGen, it was decided to more closely follow the PMS 236 as it was with Relative Risk, and as such the CIMT configurations were added to WFDSS NextGen. The PMS 236 implementation in WFDSS NextGen will be updated to reflects any changes to the NWCG 236 as they are published. &#160;</p>

                                                <p>Decision Approval and Publication - The final step of the decision is for the collaborating agencies to approve and publish the decision. It is at this point that the working files become an official record of the fire. One complicated and time-consuming part of this feature is the encapsulation of all the information included in the decision to this point in a PDF document that can then be retained as part of the permanent record. </p>

                                        <p>The design of WFDSS NG has moved from housing all the data and conducting all modeling within the application to utilizing an external, system-based framework which not only allows users to interact with the most current data sources and models but takes the computational load off of the WFDSS application.  Current and edited Landscapes will be provided by the LANDFIRE Product Service (LFPS), weather and climatology data will be provided by the Fire Environment Mapping System (FEMS) and the computation is completed using the Fire Modeling Services Framework (FMSF), all without the analyst leaving the WFDSS NG application.</p>
                                        <p>With the initial release of WFDSS NG, only the FSPro model will be available.  Users with Editor roles will be able to request FSPro analyses while those users with the Fire Behavior Analyst role and above will be able to calibrate and run the analyses.  Priority was given to FSPro as the model is not available outside of the WFDSS system as a desktop application. Future enhancements will include the incorporation of the FlamMap, MTT and FARSITE models.</p>
