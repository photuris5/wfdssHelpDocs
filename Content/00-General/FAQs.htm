At this time, the application only allows for one Approver to Approve and Publish a decision; multiple approver concurrence can be tracked in the Decision Rationale tab or Decision Assessment/Approval Notes (this feature area is still in development).</p>
                                                <p><b>Supporting information available within the application <u>do not </u>automatically populate in the Decision document. </b> To include maps and charts&#160;in the Decision document, images can be captured by using the Print Map tool on the Map Widgets toolbar, downloading charts an image file using the hamburger icon in the upper right corner of the chart, or by simply using an image capture tool on your computer, and pasting into the associated narrative box. For example, adding the image of a vicinity map and/or Planning Area map in the Rationale narrative will display that map at the beginning of the Decision document within the Rationale section.</p>
                                                <p><b>Each section</b> must be marked as Ready for Publication using the toggle at the bottom of the Right Hand Panel. In future releases, this validation will automatically populate the check boxes in the Required Decisions Elements in the Decision Approval &amp; Assessment tab. Until that functionality is operational, users will have to manually check those boxes to be able to Approve and Publish a Decision. </p>
                                                <p>The Decision Approval &amp; Assessment accordion under the Decision Approval/Assessment tab (Number of Days Between Required Assessments and Decision Approval/Approval Notes) can only be submitted by Approvers assigned to the Incident. At this time, these notes do not persist and do not populate in the Decision. To document any approval notes, it is recommended to use a screen capture tool and store with official documentation.</p>
                                                <p>There is no Notification functionality available from the application at this time - Approvers will need to track the number of days and set up a reminder outside of the application.</p>
                                                <p>The vision behind WFDSS is to create a living document to support Risk-Informed Decision Making. Every Assessment creates a new Decision document. This allows for maximum flexibility in aligning decision content with the fire environment.</p>

                                                <p>The modernization of the WFDSS application is being realized through a full redesign and reconfiguration utilizing an agile process where the end result will not only preserve the key functionality of the previous operational version of WFDSS, referred to as WFDSS Classic, while incorporating some key foundational technology changes that will improve user experience. This application includes a new user interface as well as an updated systems architecture. It is estimated that WFDSS NextGen will host over 8,000 active users annually and will reference 100 to 150 data services within the mapping interface.</p>
                                                <p>The initial production release includes the features deemed part of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and will include the necessary features to allow decision makers to fully progress through the decision framework and publish a decision.</p>

                                                        <p>Spatial Inventory – The need for a complete picture of the values within your planning area when making an informed decision, and as such this key aspect touches many other parts of an informed decision. In order to facilitate the automated delivery of a Spatial Inventory WFDSS NextGen uses an automated planning are to produce a Spatial Inventory on the start of a decision, however a user can use a variety of Feature Layers to develop additional Spatial Inventories.</p>
                                                    </li>

                                                        <p>FSPro – Fire Spread Probability (FSPro) model was identified as the priority for fire behavior modeling within WFDSS NextGen primarily because there is no desktop or web-based alternative to run WFDSS NextGen, whereas FlamMap, MTT, and FARSITE all have alternatives available in desktop applications. FSPro was also the most difficult model to incorporate and the most complex due to the dependencies on the Fire Environment Mapping System (FEMS) to query the weather imports for analyses. Although there are still challenges and issues with the FEMS queries needed to make FSPro work consistently and reliably, FSPro is currently integrated and working.</p>

                                                        <p>Relative Risk - Also known as the “Part B: Relative Risk Assessment”, is part of the “NWCG PMS 236 - Wildland Fire Risk and Complexity Assessment”. In the past, this tool had deviated from the published PMS – 236 within WFDSS Classic, however currently both WFDSS Classic and WFDSS NextGen will more closely follow the PMS 236 in order to align with NWCG guidance. The deployment in WFDSS NextGen does have some advantages over the paper copy (PDF) in that the application can automatically present products derived from the spatial Inventory of the planning area, and in future, present other information such as fire behavior analysis, helping to inform the Relative Risk ratings. Relative Risk has been further enhanced by the fact that the user never leaves the map screen, allowing for the user to consult the map on the fly as the Relative Risk is populated vs paging back and forth between the map and the Relative Risk.</p>

For the context of the MVP however the decision is broken into its core components which are listed below:</p>

Minor differences have been implemented in WFDSS NextGen including, making all Spatial Assessments Spatial (Tied to Feature Layer and Feature Name), linking the Critical Values at Risk (CVAR) from the ISAP process, the additional categories of Spatial Assessments (SA), highlighting in the decision of select SAs and the pre-clipping of Spatial Fire Planning Shapes.</p>

In WFDSS NextGen, it was decided to more closely follow the PMS 236 as it was with Relative Risk, and as such the CIMT configurations were added to WFDSS NextGen. The PMS 236 implementation in WFDSS NextGen will be updated to reflects any changes to the NWCG 236 as they are published. &#160;</p>

It is at this point that the working files become an official record of the fire. One complicated and time-consuming part of this feature is the encapsulation of all the information included in the decision to this point in a PDF document that can then be retained as part of the permanent record.</p>
