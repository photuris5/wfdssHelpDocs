                                                </p>
                                                <p>As we pass the 90-day mark of the implementation of WFDSS NG as the system of record for Federal wildland fire incidents, the WFDSS team has been as busy as ever with a focus on improving user experience and adding functionality.</p>
                                                <h4>WHAT'S NEW?</h4>
                                                <p>On June 12th, WFDSS v1.0.2 was released, marking the second minor release after the initial v1.0 release. Minor releases generally address identified bugs and application maintenance and updates. The Release Notes can be found on the WFDSS Homepage under What’s New.  The team is working to provide new releases every 4-6 weeks going forward to be responsive to the field.</p>
                                                <h4>WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON</h4>
                                                <p>The development team is working on the automated system validation of required elements of the decision, incorporating the Fire Modeling Services Framework v2 for more agile modeling, updating URLs, displaying FSPro status updates, coverage validation for LANDFIRE data layers, and an upgrade to the ArcServer. The first pieces of the second fire behavior model (FARSITE) are also starting to move through the system.</p>
                                                <p>The features we are excited to release later in 2025 include approving decisions with multiple approvers, incorporating the remaining fire behavior models (FlamMap and MTT), the ability to copy an analysis, User and System Notifications, Incident History, creating an incident in EDU (Non-IRWIN records), ERC climatology graphs, and more!</p>
                                                <p>The services that WFDSS relies on are also undergoing enhancements and we look forward to connecting to FMSF v2, FEMS 3.2 and LFPS upgrades. It takes a lot of communication between the teams to keep the systems and services aligned - <b>we couldn’t do it without them!</b></p>

                                                <p>WFDSS NextGen development is in the final stage ahead of becoming the system of record. The next 3 weeks will be exciting as we wrap up feature development for the first release (1.0). The code lock for the 1.0 release has begun and over the next 3 weeks the WFMRD&amp;A will be engaging in robust testing, supporting training and course content development, as well as inviting users to participate in application testing and providing feedback, all in preparation of the full transition to WFDSS NextGen on March 26th.</p>
                                                <p>The current operational version of WFDSS will be maintained in its current state of Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) with no Development Modernization or Enhancements (DME) taking place. Only patching and necessary technical upgrades and changes necessary to comply with CIO policy and hosting environment requirements have been occurring as we continue to prepare for WFDSS Classic's archiving.</p>
                                                <p>WFDSS NextGen EDU (Training) is now available for user training. While all the features have not made their way to the training environment they will be soon.</p>
                                                <p>It is important to note that some features that were intended to be in the 1.0 release had to be pushed out in order to make the March 26th deadline. Namely Multiple Approvers and system validation of required elements of the decision have had to be pushed to the 1.1 release which is slated for end of April or Mid-May depending on o development cadence. Other often used features in Classic that won't be included in the 1.0 release that will be released in FY2025 include: FARSITE, FlamMap, MTT, the ability to copy an analysis, User and System Notifications, and Incident History</p>

Because these users will be the ones tasked with approving accounts for others, it made sense to get them into the system first so that we could work any bugs out of the account approval process.</p>
